    <b>Summary</b><br>
    During this week of Commservus development, we met with Danny's place and continued our coding. The meeting with Danny's place was just a status update so there is nothing big to
    update on it.
    <br><br>
    <b>Evidence</b><br>
    I would love to supply my code for a progress update, but I feel that would be unnecessary. Instead I'll provide a link to the meeting notes with Danny's place.

    <b>Reflection</b>
    This week was a very stressful week for me, and I'm glad it's over. I was able to get some necessary things done inside the codebase and also met with Danny's place.
