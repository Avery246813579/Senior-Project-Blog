    <b>Summary</b><br>
    During this week of Commservus development, we meet with Mrs. Dempsey and coded. The meeting with Mrs. Dempsey was just a catch up meeting and nothing really new sprouted from it. For coding, in specific we added the following to the website:
    <br>- Viewing your submitted applications
    <br>- Viewing your events and organization events
    <br>- Searching for events and organizations
    <br>- Other small additions
    <br><br>
    <b>Evidence</b><br>
    Evidence is a very hard thing to prove for our project. Like last week, we could show the code that we added, but that would be
    useless unless you knew how to code. Instead I will share links that shows progression with our codebase's.<br><br>

    <b>Reflection</b><br>
    Coding was fun. The meeting was helpful. Nothing else to really reflect on.
