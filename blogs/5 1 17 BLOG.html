    <b>Summary</b><br>
    On this episode of Senior Project with Avery, a shocking turn of events happened, Avery programmed. While this might be
    a suprise to the newer views, if you were with the program from the start it makes a lot of sense. The leadup to this
    epsode had Avery coding, and then out of the blue he started to program stuff. What stuff did he program? A lot of the
    stuff. Maybe some event stuff or organization stuff? But he stopped writing down what he did a long time ago. What's next
    for Avery? Is he going to start coding again? Will he ever win over his new Rabbits? Find out next week on Avery's Blog
    Post Updates That Don't Make Any Sense He Is Just Doing It For The Grade!

    <b>Evidence</b><br>
    The code is now private. The evidence of my progress is the blood, sweat, and tears on my face every day.

    <b>Reflection</b><br>
    Once in every programmers life, you have a day that makes you question everything. It's a day that every programmer knows
    will happen but you never believe it will. This day has not yet happened to me, but maybe one day it will. You might be
    asking yourself: What is this dreaded day? Personally I don't know, I just made this day up. Is there actually a day like
    this? Probably not. But maybe in one universe there is a day like this. Maybe one day.
