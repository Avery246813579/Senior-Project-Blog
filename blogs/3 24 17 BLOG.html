    <b>Summary</b><br>
    During this week of Commservus development we coded. For coding, in specific we added the following to the website:
    <br>- Added viewing organization groups
    <br>- Started to make the website look good
    <br>- Made the website way more secure (huge update)
    <br><br>Here is a small look of the new theme:

    <b>Evidence</b><br>
    Evidence is a very hard thing to prove for our project. Like last week, we could show the code that we added, but that would be
    useless unless you knew how to code. Instead I will share links that shows progression with our codebase's.<br><br>

    <b>Reflection</b><br>
    Before you learned how to read, when you would look at a book everything would be foreign.
    Then slowly you learned about letters and words and you could start reading sentences and paragraphs. Reading is like programming.
    At first everything is foreign, but after learning about it more everything gets easier. To get to the point, I really need
    to learn how to read. <br><br> I hope this reflection is worthy enough of a 25/25 because I put a lot of effort into it.
