    <b>Summary</b><br>
    During this week of senior project, I did a lot of programming. I might have done a lot of coding as well. Is there a
    difference? No. They are the same thing. But coding sounds more nerdy and programming sounds more sophisticated and
    grown up. So that's why I say programming instead of coding.
    <br><br>
    <b>Evidence</b><br>
    The code is now private. The evidence of my progress is the stress and exhaustion on my face every day.
    <br>
    <b>Reflection</b><br>
    A wise man once told me: Coding takes a lot of time. I took these words to heart and it's something I now live by.
    Since I code a lot this quote really hit close to home. It's plastered on my wall and when I turn 18 I think I'm going
    to get it tattooed. It's just such a true quote and I hope one day I can live up to it.
