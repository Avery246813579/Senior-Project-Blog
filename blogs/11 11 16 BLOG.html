    <b>My Essential Question: </b>
    <br>
    How can we improve the system that our community uses for service opportunities?
    <br><br>
    <b>Why do you want to undertake the challenge reflected in this EQ?  What about this EQ appeals to you?</b>
    <br><br>
    I want to undertake the challenge reflected in the EQ because I feel it's something the community needs, and I am very fond of the idea. Our community needs a new way to handle service events, and I think my product will do that. My EQ appeals to me because I wanted to help people that can't find and host community service opportunities.

    <b>What are your next steps towards creating this product?</b>
    <br><br>
    The first step is starting development on the server. While this is going on, I need to talk to Danny's Place U Project about an investment. After the server is done the development on the mobile client and website can start.
