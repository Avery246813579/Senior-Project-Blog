    <b>My Essential Question: </b>
    <br>
    How can we improve the system that our community uses for service opportunities?
    <br><br>
    <b>Why do you want to undertake the challenge reflected in this EQ?  What about this EQ appeals to you?</b>
    <br><br>
    While mowing my lawn the other day, I was trying to figure out what I wanted to do for my senior project. I knew that I wanted to do something regarding programming, but my initial thought was a website to teach programming. Then sporadically a video I watched popped into my head. A school who held an event to mow the lawns of their town's elder residents. I started to move my idea from teaching people to program, to helping the community and elderly. Once I began to think and ponder on the idea, I changed it into helping people with community service opportunities. I really liked the idea of helping people, and having an easier means of doing so would be the greatest way to impact those in need.
    <br><br>
    <b>How does this question demonstrate the need for substantial research?  What new knowledge do you need to gain?</b>
    <br><br>
    The essential question is very broad so we can create a heap of research questions. This topic of changing the community service system hasn't really been reasearched, so we have a lot of new knowledge to gain. Once we learn this knowledge we can construct a solution to greatly improve our system.
    <br><br>
    <b>Explain how/why your EQ cannot be answered through secondary research alone.  How does it require you to apply new knowledge? What original thinking is required?</b>
    <br><br>
    My EQ cannot be answered thought secondary research alone because it's a very unique question that hasn't been vastly researched. We haven't changed the community service system itself in a while, and doing so while applying new knowledge could vastly improve the opportunities and lives of those in need. We have to think originally about a new system that would work for every party in the service communities.
    <br><br>
    <b>Here is a short list of some research questions:</b><br>
    - Since there is no graduation requirement, how will we inspire people to do community service?<br>
    - Could we have a community service challenge amongst grades?<br>
    - How can we reach more people in the community?<br>
    - What features need to be added in so that schools would use this new system?<br>
    <br>
    <b>Product Idea:</b>
    <br>
    My product idea is a platform that communities can use to find, host, and track service opportunities. This includes a website, server, and mobile applications for IOS, Android, and Windows. This idea would challenge my programming knowledge and make me research into mobile applications. I really want to make a platform that schools and communities can use that greatly improve the quantity and quality of service opportunities. I will be learning the Xamarin platform for the mobile applications and more advanced cryptography for better security. I will be continuing to use my knowledge in Html, Css, Js, and Node.js for the server and website, but I will be refining my knowledge in C# for the mobile application.
