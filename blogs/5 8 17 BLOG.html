    <b>Summary</b><br>
    This week was the week. The week that it all happened. I could not believe that this week actually happened. It all started
    with me programming my senior project, then out of the blue it happened. I was so shocked that it happened. It was something
    I wish I could have seen coming. It's something that every programmer wants to have happened. It's something called sleep.
    It was pretty fun actually. It felt really nice. I might need more of this.

    <b>Evidence</b><br>
    The code is now private. The evidence of my progress is the 5 dollars I left on Fish Fish's desk. (this was a joke)

    <b>Reflection</b><br>
    If somehow robots can grow smarter then humans, I would be scared. But what would be the difference between a computer
    and a human. If a computer can have emotions and have thoughts what's the thing that separates human and machine. If you
    think about it, the brain works just like a computer, so if we could make a computer that worked like a brain would it be
    human too? What makes a human human? What makes a computer a computer? What is a computer? What is programming? What are
    blog posts? What is pointless filler text?
