    <b>Summary of Progress:</b>
    <br><br>

    I have had a meeting with both Mrs. Dempsey in the counseling department who manages the community service things at our school, and I have also meet with Danny's Place about a grant.
    The meeting with Mrs. Dempsey showed me what I need to add to the product for schools to use. The meeting with Danny's Place got me a grant and the much needed money for starting up
    the products servers and development.

    <b>Reflection on Progress:</b>
    <br><br>

    After having the meeting with Danny's Place, I learned about what's needed for a grant and what company's want when you take their money. They asked me many questions and requested
    lots of unique and useful features.

    <b>Evidence of Progress:</b>
    <br><br>

    The biggest evidence of progress is the document I made for the meeting with Danny's Place
    (<a href="https://docs.google.com/a/frostbyte.co/document/d/1xVD6_LoGLo7z6yMX85xHaMO6qpwC8FtXlHKxKlNMXjA/edit?usp=sharing">which can be found here</a>).

    <b>Future Progress:</b>
    <br><br>

    The future of my project is the most important part, and the part that's actually making the product. Since we have secured the money for the product to start, the first major cloud of
    stress has dissipated. At the moment I have to create invoices for Danny's place, write a development schedule, and develop a server. All of which is needed before January 1. After that
    the project is just development and meeting deadlines that are yet to be set.
