    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I conducted my interview on November 16th with Mrs. Dempsey. The meeting was held in her room in the counseling center. I got in contact with Mrs. Dempsey after numerous people mentioned
    her and gave me her email and after much hesitation I sent her an email and we worked out a date.
    <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The main thing that Mrs. Dempsey said to help me was about how we could monetize the project. Going into the interview it was unclear how I would get money for the project. I was unsure if
    schools were willing to pay
    for my product, and I knew ads were an options but hard to form a business model around. I really needed to find out how much, if any, a school was willing to pay to use my service. Thankfully Mrs. Dempsey said that
    she was very interested in the project and that she (the school) would be willing to pay for it. She said that she would pay "anything south of 1,000 dollars per year", which was way north of the amount I thought she
    would offer. I imagined that if the school was to pay for Commservus, they would pay at most $200. Hearing that they would pay up to $1,000 took a huge weight off my shoulders. I could use just a fraction of that
    money to pay for the servers and my project would live on after the initial funding.
    <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The interview was helpful in giving me a ceiling for the price, but it still had me questioning what the actually price will be. As much as I would like to price the service at $1,000 per
    school, I still want this
    project to be affordable and accessible for schools that might not have the money AB does. I wanted to finalize the price on a certain number of students that the organization would have to start paying for. This
    number is very hard to calculate, and would (and is) taking lots of time to try and find. Speaking in terms of AB, we have about 2,000 students and they are willing to spend $1,000, hypothetically I should be pricing
    the project at $1 per two students. However like I stated before I want it to be much cheaper, something like $1 per five students. Although it's easy hypothesizing, the only way I can actually find out the price is
    using this model in practice. I also shouldn't be worrying about this right now, since I already have initial funding and need to actually finish the product before I can sell it.
    <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Another very helpful thing Mrs. Dempsey helped me with is helping me find competitors for my project. As unique of an idea I had, I knew there was something like it floating about. Mrs.
    Dempsey was able to help me
    find products that were similar to mine, and after the meeting emailed a list to me (email is attached as a pdf). This really helps me craft my product in making it more unique and a better alternative to the other
    projects.
    <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The interview hasn't changed the direction Commservus is going, but it definitely refined the hard edges. Before the interview there were multiple topics that I was unsure about. Either I
    didn't know exactly what I
    needed to have for a topic or what features were actually wanted. Talking to a person who would actually be using the project was extremely helpful in the way that it refine my ideas and confirmed what I was doing
    was correct. I would say the interview didn't changed the direction, but instead reined it down.
    <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The most rewarding part of the interview was actually interacting with a person my project would be helping. My project says it will improve the current system we use, and after talking to
    Mrs. Dempsey I can confirm
    that it actually will. My favorite part about the meeting in general is seeing how excited Mrs. Dempsey was for the project and how eager she was to help out. It really helps motivate me when I know people are
    looking forward to my project.
    <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I think the interview was somewhat useful since I already knew most of the information disclosed, but it was nice having confirmation on how everything works. I did get some new insights on
    what a school system would
    really want and value about my project, but a lot of what she said were suspicions I already had.
